This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily missed, increment operator behavior in Java. The `BuggyIncrement.java` file contains code that unexpectedly increments the counter variable. The `CorrectedIncrement.java` file shows the solution to the issue, and the way it is addressed is explained in the code comments. This scenario highlights the importance of understanding operator precedence in coding.
